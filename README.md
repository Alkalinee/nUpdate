### Installation

There is currently no real installation, just download the whole solution and build it. If you are using .NET 4.0 and use the binaries located in "Provide TAP" you will have to install Microsoft.Bcl (Microsoft Async) in order to use the library as it implements async-await for the TAP. With .NET 4.5 you won't have to install anything, neither in "No TAP", nor in "Providing TAP". Make sure to start the Administration with admin privileges the first time, so that the registry key for the extension can be created.
A documentation on how to use nUpdate's components and how to customize it will follow soon.

### Development

Want to contribute as said above? Great!
Just use GitHub's functions for creating issues on problems so that I could have a look at them and decide what to do etc. If you already have an idea on what to do, make sure to fork nUpdate and create a PullRequest.

### Todo's
There are still a lot of things to do till a really good and usable version will appear. I'm giving my best to hurry up a bit.
